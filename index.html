          Frankenstein!
        </h1>

        <p>I'm actively learning to use React Native, after giving some thought to the choice between <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>          and <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/">NativeScript</a>. Ultimately, the decision to go with React Native
          (for me) came down to the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><em>Facebook</em> is a larger organization than the <em>Progress Software Corporation</em>. Their work on NativeScript
              looks to accomplish the same, and to be honest, a better fit in principle for me since I'm an AngularJS developer,
              but I'm also curious about existing plugins, social login etc. in native apps, and would like to leverage what
              seems to be a larger collection of components available for React Native.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The Facebook app is a widely known, widely used mobile application, that accomplishes a number of great features.
              That example is a compelling one that indicates that Facebook's approach with creating <em>React Native</em>              had to take into consideration ALL they would like to do with their native app, serving over 1 billion users
              worldwide
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>I'm joining a project that's written in <a href="http://www.telescopeapp.org/" target="_blank">Telescope</a>,
              which is <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> + <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html">React</a>              framework. working with React Native will get me in a <em>React frame of mind</em> for participating in that
              project. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please take these considerations with a grain of salt. Your answer, may be NativeScript if you already have an AngularJS
          skillbase and don't have any immediate need to work with super-native functionality (you might have to write components
          of your own - and you can!). I encourage all to give NativeScript a look first before going any further. They both
          appeal to me for their <em>all-native code output</em> approach. If it helps, <a href="http://blog.backand.com/angular-2-nativescript-vs-react-native/">this article</a>          was also a great source of information while I grappled with the decision.</p>

        <h1>
          <a id="why-frankenstein" class="anchor" href="#why-frankenstein" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why
          Frankenstein?
        </h1>

        <p>I noticed the tutorials on the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html">React Native getting started page</a>          were in bits and pieces, and I found myself wanting an <em>all-in</em> example of the framework in action (it might
          be someplace - haven't found it yet). So, I'm sharing my hodge-podge project as I put together the sample code
          from the tutorials, as well as leverage a couple libraries to accomplish some tasks easier (in my opinion).</p>

        <p>The intent is to keep this updated as I find better tools for different things - maintain different branches if necessary
          to illustrate all the different approaches.</p>

        <p><strong>Please use this as a reference while you go through the React Native getting started guide - this is NOT a replacement for that</strong>,
          just all the sample code together in a buildable project. </p>

        <p>Enjoy! Hope this helps. </p>
